# Facial Emotion Recognition using CNN on FER-2013

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on the [FER-2013 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013) for real-time facial emotion recognition. The model classifies facial expressions into one of seven emotion categories: *Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral*.
